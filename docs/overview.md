# Overview

Welcome to the `gori-deep-train` project documentation. This project comprises a series of generic training, evaluation and analysis pipelines for deep learning models using PyTorch. The core Python package upon which it is built is the `gori-deep-train-core` package.

Everything has been written with generalizability in mind, so that it is possible to accomodate for any models, losses, datasets, transforms and more, all under a standard framework. It is also possible to extend this project by writing new pipelines using the components defined in the `gori-deep-train-core` package.

To begin, I recommend checking the [Getting Started](getting-started.md) section, which explains how to setup this project if you wish to use it. After that, you can review the documentation of each script.

<font color="red">**DISCLAIMER**</font>: While this project is fully functional, it is not currently in a stable or production-ready state. Documentation may not be complete, many dependencies may be missing and you may find known and unknown bugs. This repository is mainly for showcase purposes, rather than to provide a fully supported, easy-to-run package.
